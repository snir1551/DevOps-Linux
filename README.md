## 1. Basic Linux Commands

```bash
# Basic commands to Navigate and manage directories

pwd                   # Print current directory
ls                    # List contents of the directory
mkdir devops_test     # Create new directory
cd devops_test        # Change to that directory
touch testfile.txt    # Create a test file
rm testfile.txt       # Delete the test file
cd ..                 # Go back one directory (can also do cd ../../ and etc)
rm -r devops_test     # Delete the directory
```

## 2. Create Users and Assign to Custom Group

```bash
# Create a new group
sudo groupadd devopsteam

# Create users and assign them to the group
sudo useradd -m -G devopsteam user1
sudo useradd -m -G devopsteam user2

# Verify group membership
groups user1
groups user2
```


## 3. Change File and Directory Permissions

```bash
# Create a directory and a file
mkdir /tmp/secure_folder
touch /tmp/secure_folder/groupfile.txt

# Change ownership to a user and group
sudo chown user1:devopsteam /tmp/secure_folder/groupfile.txt

# Change permissions to allow group read/write
sudo chmod 660 /tmp/secure_folder/groupfile.txt

# Verify permissions
ls -l /tmp/secure_folder/groupfile.txt
```

## Part 1: Creating Directory Structure & Permissions

```bash
# Create base project directory in user's home directory
mkdir -p ~/project1/docs ~/project1/scripts

# Set permissions
chmod 744 ~/project1/scripts  # Owner: rwx, Group/Others: r--
chmod 777 ~/project1/docs     # Everyone: rwx (write access for all users)
```

## Part 2: User & Group Management

```bash
# Create user and group
sudo groupadd devteam
sudo useradd -g devteam devuser

# Set 'project1' ownership to your user and give group read-only access
sudo chown $USER:devteam ~/project1
chmod 740 ~/project1  # Owner: rwx, Group: r--, Others: ---
```

## Part 3: Verification Commands

```bash
# Show final directory structure and permissions
ls -lR ~/project1

# Show group membership for devuser
groups devuser
```

## Command Explanations

- `mkdir -p`: Creates directories; `-p` ensures parent directories are made as needed.
- `chmod 744`: Sets file/directory permissions (`7`=rwx, `4`=r--).
- `chmod 777`: Gives full read/write/execute permissions to all.
- `groupadd`: Adds a new group to the system.
- `useradd -m -g`: Creates a user and assigns him to a primary group.
- `chown`: Changes ownership of a file or directory.
- `ls -lR`: Recursively lists directory contents with permissions.
- `groups`: Shows all groups a user belongs to.

### üêö Bash Script Commands Reference

This document provides a categorized reference of Bash commands, operators, and syntax elements used in the script.

---

#### üß† General Bash Concepts

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
